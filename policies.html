                        <em>Store</em> or <em>Site</em>, is handled by third-party companies such as <em>Printify</em>

                    <p>Shipping for all <em>Print-On-Demand</em> items is managed solely by the printing companies. Once
                        an order is placed, it is fulfilled and shipped by these third-party providers. Therefore,
                        shipping times, costs, and handling of your

                        such cases, please contact us with evidence of
                        the issue, and we will coordinate with the provider for a replacement or refund as applicable.
